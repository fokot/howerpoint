# Howerpoint - forget about Powerpoint!!

* **ghci** terminal-based slide-show presentations that you can control from the REPL and execute code on slides
* idea (no code) stolen from [REPLesent](https://github.com/marconilanna/REPLesent)

_It's only a single Haskell file!_

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/42096.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/42096)

To run presentation create presentation as a text file.
Run `stack ghci` and have in the in the root of the project

    $ stack ghci
    Howerpoint> :loadPresentation PATH-TO-PRESENTATION

Good stating poitn is test presentations

    $ stack ghci
    Howerpoint> :loadTestPresentation

### ANSI colors

Escape code	| Result
--- | ---
\x | Foreground color, where x is one of: blac`k`, `r`ed, `g`reen, `y`ellow, `b`lue, `m`agenta, `c`yan, `w`hite
\X | Background color, where capital X is one of the same as above
\0 | Resets foreground and background colors to terminal default

### Code

All code is run in ghci so don't forget `let`s and `:m +` as imports etc.

**\>\>\>** show code on a slide and also the same code will be run

    >>>putStrLn . show $ double 5

**L\>\>** show code on a slide and when the code is run it prepends `let`

    L>>double x = x + x

**H\>\>** doesn't show code on a slide but the code is run. It's useful for imports

    H>>:m +Data.Char
